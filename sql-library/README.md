# TechDegree-project8
 SQL Library Manager

This project was initialized with the Express Generator. I highly reccomend it for any Express project as it stream lines much of the busywork in setting up an Express app.

## Installation

In the CLI of your choice, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Use
Demonstrates use of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) of books at a library. Categories can be modified in models/book.js and in order to be rendered, must be updated in books/show.pug. Books must have at least a title and author in order to be created.
